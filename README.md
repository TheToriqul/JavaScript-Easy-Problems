# JavaScript Easy Problems

This repository contains solutions to JavaScript problems, designed to help beginners practice their coding skills. Each problem focuses on different aspects of JavaScript programming, including function creation, input validation, and basic algorithms. I am continuously adding new problem-solving codes to this repository as I encounter more challenges and explore new concepts.

## Problems Included

This repository currently includes solutions to the following problems, with more to be added in the future:

1. **Calculate Tax**: A function to calculate tax based on income and expenses.
2. **Send Notification**: A function to generate a notification message from an email address.
3. **Check Digits in Name**: A function to check if a name contains any digits.
4. **Calculate Final Score**: A function to calculate a final score based on test scores and other criteria.
5. **Calculate Waiting Time**: A function to estimate waiting time based on previous service times.

(More problems will be added to this list as they are solved and uploaded to the repository.)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/JavaScript-Easy-Problems.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd JavaScript-Easy-Problems
   ```

3. Each problem is contained in its own JavaScript file. You can run these files using Node.js or include them in your HTML file to run in a browser.

4. To test the functions, you can call them with various inputs and log the results to the console.

## Function Descriptions

1. `calculateTax(income, expenses)`: Calculates tax based on income and expenses.
2. `sendNotification(email)`: Generates a notification message from an email address.
3. `checkDigitsInName(name)`: Checks if a name contains any digits.
4. `calculateFinalScore(obj)`: Calculates a final score based on test scores and other criteria.
5. `waitingTime(waitingTimes, serialNumber)`: Estimates waiting time based on previous service times.

## How I Use This Repo

- I regularly add new JavaScript files as I explore new concepts or come across interesting challenges.
- I revisit and refactor older code as my skills improve, allowing me to see my progress over time.
- This serves as a personal reference for various JavaScript implementations I've worked on.

## Note

This is a personal practice repository. The code here may not be optimized or follow best practices in all cases, as it represents my learning journey.
